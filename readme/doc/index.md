# Build Your Design System from Scratch - A Workshop

This repo contains a design system sample for a workshop where
attendees will work on implementing a design system made of
tokens, a few components, and a theme feature.

## Chapters

1. What is a Design System?
2. Tokens: using style-dictionary to generate tokens from an
   external source
3. Components: making core elements with WebComponents
4. Documentation: creating a layout for consistency
5. Organisms: consuming design system resources and documenting them
6. Theming: cascading the tokens
7. Publishing: being ready to distribute
8. Future of design systems: having a look at the upcoming
   web features empowering the design system tooling

## Getting started

### Architecure

The design system is organised in packages, a flat-way. They are split in different
sections:

1. _tokens_: values and variables definitions of the different parts of your brands
2. _core_: the low-level elements to build your views and advanced components on
3. _components_: high-level components ready to be used in your application

### Core/Components

The different components are made with vanilla webcomponents in plain JS. All components
packages exposes a root `index.js` file which re-exposes the component. Using them need
no more than importing the package and using the webcomponent (prefixed with `ds-`) in
your views.

### Styles

Styles from _tokens_ and _core_ are made with Sass. Packages can expose `mixins` that are
gathered in the root `mixins.scss` file. So using mixins only needs to `@use mixins.scss`
then `@include mixins.[mixinName]` in your Sass files.

Global styles are gathered in the root `styles.scss` file, meaning you need to import it
(or its `styles.css` dist version) in your final app to embed the overall styles.
