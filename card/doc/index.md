# components/card

This package contains the SCSS definitions for cards styles. It's made of:

1. a _mixins_ file for generating cards definitions
2. a style file imported in the global stylesheet containing the exploited mixins to
   define global card variants styles (e.g.`.card1`, `.card2`, ...)
